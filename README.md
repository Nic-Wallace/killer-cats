# KILLER CATS

Killer Cats is a text-based adventure game where the objective is to stay alive. After a description of the players surroundings, 
you have to choose wisely or die to an ambush of evil and armed cats. This game is set in a post-apocolyptic world where cats
grew opposable thumbs and rallied against the humans and dogs of the world. The playable character is a human who wakes up with
amnesia and must try to survive.

## UX

I included text art to the welcome page of the game to show users what the game is about as well as giving them some information
about how to play.
